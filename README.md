# Car Keys

**Project started: 15/02/2017, Last updated: 21/02/2020**

This adds a Car Keys SWEP to Garry's Mod which lets players lock, unlock, buy and sell vehicles.

If you own the vehicle you have the ability to lock it, unlock it, drive it, sell it and pick it up with your physgun. (Admins on the server still have the ablity to pickup anyones car.)

If you've bought a car and your game crashes or you leave a server, the vehicle will still be yours when you join again as long as the server doesn't restart or have prop removal on disconnect.

If you're running DarkRP with this then you'll be able to utilise the buying, selling and set price chat command. (`!setprice <amount>`)

__Currently compatible with:__ *(Should work with almost every car in the game, if it doesn't though contact me and i'll try add support)*
* Any vehicle that is based on `prop_vehicle_jeep`, `prop_vehicle_jeep_old`, `prop_vehicle_airboat` and `prop_vehicle_prisoner_pod`.

Credit goes to [Morretz](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198204059269) for creating the [key model](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=704317952), he graciously let me use it in this addon. The original texture was edited by me however.
