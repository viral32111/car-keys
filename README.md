# Car Keys
#### Version: 122

In short this addon protects others from getting in or picking up your car.

You can find the SWEP under 'Car Keys' in the 'Weapons' tab of the Spawn menu.

If you own the vehicle you have the ability to lock it (Left Click), unlock it (Right Click), drive it and pick it up with your physgun.

Supports any roleplay gamemode that includes 'rp' in the name.

For RP gamemodes you can buy and sell the car (R) prices can be configured by typing '!setprice' in chat followed by an amount while looking at the vehicle. This value will save over server restart.

If your in a server using this addon and you have bought a car and your game crashes or you leave, the vehicle will still be yours when you join again (As long as the server doesn't have some sort of prop removal on disconnect or it restarts)

Admins on the server have the ablity to pickup anyones car.
