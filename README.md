Car Keys
==========
#### Current Version: 1.0.2

Allows players to manage their vehicles.

There is alot more to this addon than what is in the screenshots, but these things can't have screenshots as most of it is just back-end code.

This addon allows you to buy your vehicle (Press R) once you have spawned it. Once you have bought it no one else can do anything to your vehicle. It's yours!

If you own the vehicle you have the ability to lock it (Left Click), unlock it (Right Click), drive it and pick it up with your physgun.

If you press R again once its yours it will sell it, Use this if you don't want it anymore.

If you ever leave and come back to a multiplayer game, or your game crashes the vehicle will still be yours when you join again (As long as the server doesn't have some sort of prop removal on disconnect).
