Car Keys

#### Current Version: 1.2.0

##### Please report any bugs or errors you find in the Issues section or on the workshop comments!

In short this addon protects others from getting in or picking up your car.

You can find the SWEP under "viral32111's scripts" in the Weapons tab of the Spawn menu.

If you own the vehicle you have the ability to lock it, unlock it, drive it and pick it up with your physgun.

If your in a server using this addon and you have bought a car and your game crashes or you leave, the vehicle will still be yours when you join again (As long as the server doesn't have some sort of prop removal on disconnect or it restarts)

Admins on the server have the ablity to pickup anyones car.

This addon should work with almost every car on the workshop. I know that it works with: TDMCars, SligWolf's Vehicles, LW Cars, SCars, Simfphys Lua Vehicles and the Half Life 2 Vehicles. If it does not work with a vehicle contact me and i'll try to make it work with it.

Controls:
* Lock: Left Click
* Unlock: Right Click
* Buy/Sell: R

Commands:
* !setprice <amount> (Use while looking at the vehicle, only works on RP gamemodes)
